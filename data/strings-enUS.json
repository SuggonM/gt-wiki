  "cafe_s8_12": "It's partner over rival!",
  "cafe_s8_13": "Hmpf! I'm not to be fooled by such petty lie!",
  "cafe_s8_15": "You're up against me in a quiz battle!",
  "cafe_s8_16": "It'll be about the essential facts that a rival or a partner shall definitely know.",
  "cafe_s8_17": "If you get 2 out of 3, it's your win. Or else, it's my win.",

  "china_main_s4_47": "Thus, starting today, you are now this old master's disciples.",

  "dragon_talon_s2_27": "Pfft.",
  "dragon_talon_s2_28": "Hoshida! Those are candies! Not poison!",

  "dragon_talon_s2_35": "If you eat a lot of candies, you're at a higher risk of getting cavities, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and much more!",
  "dragon_talon_s2_36": "That's our boss! What an amazing plan!",
  "dragon_talon_s2_37": "Let's continue with the next part of our mission!",

  "dragon_talon_s3_19": "How dare you interrupting our raid...",
  "dragon_talon_s3_20": "And what is that... a bear?",
  "dragon_talon_s3_21": "I'm not a bear! I'm a doctor!",

  "dragon_talon_s3_29": "Is that doll clothing?",
  "dragon_talon_s3_30": "Hahaha! I see you're confused.",
  "dragon_talon_s3_31": "To remain calm is the basic step of martial arts!",
  "dragon_talon_s3_32": "Boss, you're amazing!",
  "dragon_talon_s3_33": "Please! This is all basic stuff!",
  "dragon_talon_s3_34": "We are!",
  "dragon_talon_s3_35": "Ugh... I can't believe a kid and a bear interrupted the ambush...",
  "dragon_talon_s3_36": "You're quite brave to call the doctor a bear.",
  "dragon_talon_s3_37": "Boss, let us head back. I'm so tired...",
  "dragon_talon_s3_38": "Okay! We'll need rest for the bigger things to come!",
  "dragon_talon_s3_39": "You go first! Doctor has some business with this one!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_10": "What? It's getting chilly in here!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_11": "Yup, that's it! If anyone gets in our way, we can use this to make them cold and sick!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_12": "You've thought up quite a plan, doctor!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_13": "I think I'm already catching a cold.",
  "dragon_talon_s4_14": "Hahaha! We are indeed the fear-inducing...",
  "dragon_talon_s4_15": "Wait!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_16": "Bear... I mean, doctor! You stole the crystal!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_17": "We'll take it back!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_18": "You can't do that!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_19": "I don't know what you're planning but I can't let that fall into the Viper clan's hands!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_20": "Impossible!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_21": "The crystal is now Dragon Talon clan's...",
  "dragon_talon_s4_22": "This...?",
  "dragon_talon_s4_23": "Intern, be careful!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_25": "Protect... the crystal...",
  "dragon_talon_s4_26": "No!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_27": "Intern! We'll keep them back! Take care of the crystal!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_34": "Why... am I here?",
  "dragon_talon_s4_35": "Ah... Ranpang?",
  "dragon_talon_s4_36": "I'm feeling dizzy...",
  "dragon_talon_s4_39": "Ugh... it's a pity, but I can't give you the crystal...",
  "dragon_talon_s4_40": "...because we already destroyed it.",
  "dragon_talon_s4_41": "No... we...",
  "dragon_talon_s4_42": "We...",
  "dragon_talon_s4_43": "...want to join the Dragon Talon clan!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_44": "Join us?!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_45": "Yes. After watching you fight, we realized...",
  "dragon_talon_s4_46": "...we looked down on you just because you are a kid.",
  "dragon_talon_s4_47": "We heard it was the Dragon Talon clan that helped everyone here.",
  "dragon_talon_s4_48": "We can trust and follow a leader like you.",
  "dragon_talon_s4_49": "Boss, are you crying?",
  "dragon_talon_s4_50": "I'm... not crying!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_51": "Aww... is that water coming out of your eyes?",
  "dragon_talon_s4_52": "Be... be quiet!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_53": "We should welcome our new members!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_54": "Okay, everyone! Powerfully!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_55": "Haha, intern! Are you nervous now that we've got new members?",
  "dragon_talon_s4_56": "Again! We are!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_57": "Intern! Wait a minute!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_58": "I see that you have no intention of staying here, right?",
  "dragon_talon_s4_59": "Okay, then go with Ranpang!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_60": "They'll... be fine.",
  "dragon_talon_s4_61": "Hoshida will lead them well.",
  "dragon_talon_s4_62": "I realized today that...",
  "dragon_talon_s4_63": "A person like me is too great to just stay in this city!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_64": "So intern...",
  "dragon_talon_s4_65": "No, you're more than an intern!",
  "dragon_talon_s4_66": "You'll be the underboss of the Dragon Talon clan!",

As Nari's old friend, supporter, and competitor, he wields more powerful magic than Nari since he has one extra tail than her.\n\nWhile Nari was in a deep, long sleep inside a stone statue, Garam travelled the world with Dallae, who had nowhere to go, and nurtured those in need. However, the greedy humans, who got help from Garam, pulled a scheme to steal Sage's magic which ultimately led to Dallae's death. Garam got engulfed in sorrow and rage and went on a frenzy. Nari, awakened from her sleep, alleviated Garam's frenzy and reminded him about the duty as a sage, and Garam finally calmed himself down and went on a path of training to once again uphold his duty as a sage. This time, he hopes to learn to control himself and his power through archery, and he aims to nurture a wider world with his warm heart without settling at one place.\n\nAfter training for ages in the mountains, Garam had no idea what was going on with the world. It's a shock that there are now so many people wielding magic. So many things are incomprehensible or seems without obvious purposes, no matter how much he looks at them. Magic is the only conclusion Garam can come up with when encountering all these advanced technology. He is especially sure that Sohee is a some kind of ill-tempered sage.",

She started training martial arts to get her revenge, but eventually got attracted to level of depth, both physically and spiritually, that lies within the art.\n\nShe has natural gift in martial arts. Before mater Tao took her, she already trained herself into a competent martial artist. She is hot headed and impatient, but she is starting to learn to control herself through meditation.",

He ran away from home because he wanted to use magic without getting scolded by his mother. \"I'm a dragon. I can do what I want!\" is what he said, right before his incomplete transformation magic got him stuck in a half-dragon half-human form.\n\nHe looks down on humans as they are weak and small. But it should be noted that Girgas himself is young and naive, completely new to the world. He tries to pretend nothing ever surprises him but that unfortunately fools no one.",
  "profile_eight_tail_story": "Nari is an eight-tailed fox sage.\n\nShe is born missing a tail and uses her bead to use magic. She grew up training with the nine-tailed fox, Garam. Because of her missing tail, she lacks magic powers and trained with the help of Garam. While in a long sleep in the form of a stone statue, she was awakened from desperate rituals and prayers from villagers asking for help.\n\nShe does want to allure everyone with her cute and adorable looks but detests being treated like a child. She bluntly plays the role of a cute kid, but when the opponent falls for it and treats her like one, she becomes instantly angry for thinking of her as a naive kid. Because of her short temper, she tends to be unexpectedly frank.\n\nShe may look like a child, but she has lived long ages. She speaks plainly to everyone and tends to blow on her own trumpet, which often makes her appear like a repulsive child. She's very wise and acts as the sage, helping humans in trouble. She also has old-fashioned taste compared to her looks. She likes \"sweet and savory\" butterscotch candy and prefers \"hot\" tea than cold drinks that make her tummy cold.",

She saved the animals, then she saw another poacher, kicked him out, one thing led to another and she realized she was several decades late to her appointment.\n\nBecause most poachers are humans she developed hate towards them. Maybe someone with a good heart can change her mind someday.",

She would be the greatest leaf fairy of her generation - if she was not a natural born slacker. Instead of taking care of flowers all day, she invented magical sprinklers and automated her entire job. She now spends time taking naps and reading comic books from the human world.\n\nBy her own account, she is not lazy per se. She's just efficient.",
  "profile_witch_coco_story": "Lupina is the legendary ice witch of the innuit tribe.\n\nShe is notorious for her cruelty and fickleness. She appears every once in decades and hunts people for pleasure. When she invades, the land suffers endless blizzard and snowstorms. If you dare to go out hunting in that weather, believe me, it will be you who gets hunted. She treats her victims in a variety of ways. Sometimes she would simply let them go. But most other times, she becomes very creative with killing the victims slowly and painfully. Every innuit folklore includes Lupina as a villain in some form.\n\nShe enjoys her infamy very much. She carefully calculates her reappearances so that her name will be never forgotten among people. She searches her name on web everyday. Her favorite keywords are \"Lupina witch,\" \"Lupina hot,\" and \"Lupina cosplay.\"",

Though she is in search of Girgas as her duty as an avatar, it's why she must find him before anyone else does. \n\nShe loves and is loved by mortals. Her cordial and genuine character attracts humans, though it's considered an odd trait for dragons. Wherever Vishvac stops by, she leaves a trail of friends who remember her. She's obsessed with food, especially the goods and delicacies of human food. She favors exotic and spiced-filled foods but avoids all types of greens and raw foods.",
  "profile_flower_girl_story": "Bari is a high priestess of the god of harvest. Her mission is to resurrect the burnt world tree by collecting happy memories from people.\n\nBari grants you one wish and takes your happiest memory away in return. The greater the wish, the bigger chunk of memories it'll cost. Bari always tries to remain distant to her clients to avoid getting involved with humans but often fails due to her compassionate nature. When she sees someone desperately in need but does not have enough happy memories, she chips in her own memory to grant the wish. You should not get frustrated if she doesn't remember you - it just means she cherished the memory with you and passed the happiness to another in need. \n\nShe has two rules when granting wishes. One - if her client becomes greedy and attempts to exploit her, she will make sure the client pay for the sin whether it's by her own hand or by curse of mother nature. Two - she won't bring anyone back from dead. It always made clients' lives worse.",
  "profile_golem_rider_story": "Alef is an alchemist who makes golems out of woods. \n\nAn aesthetic who covets beauty. Though it's not quite easy for other people to understand, he has his own sets of \"philosophies\" on appreciation of beauty. Not only does he appreciate the outer beauty but he also recognizes the inner beauty that's \"reflected on\" one's looks. He has his own \"Lady Radar\" and believes one that is ugly on the inside cannot make the radar ring, however beautiful on the outside. When he finds \"the real beauty,\" he willingly becomes a loyal servant of it. \n\nThough he looks like a child, he's actually 38 years old. He made a potion to make him younger because some women didn't care for older men. Yet he accidentally made the potion too strong, and turned himself into a child. It's not impossible to turn him back, but he chose to live on as he is, after seeing women become less cautious with him. \n\nHis full name he used back at home was Alefiod. He was the smart one in the prestigious alchemist family, but he always made some trouble with his laziness and fondness for women. His talents had been wasted on creating a gem as a gift for a neighborhood sweetheart, or creating a golem to do all his chores, and such. When a war broke out with a neighboring country, he created the ultimate golem out of birch woods at the request of the royal family and successfully protected the country. Thinking golem's powers as an opportunity, the royals tried to start another war. He persistently refused to use his golem for war and was eventually exiled eternally. After leaving his country, he vowed to start a new life and named himself Alef.",

She just intuitively uses them for brawls she often gets into. She hopes to become the ultimate fighting champion of the world much to the dismay of the devil queen (who is, by the way, funding her tuition).\n\nShe loves her brother but gives him a hard time because... well, because it's her brother.

She openly expresses how less evolved other people are and loves to correct other people.

She therefore puts on the diva dress and accessories to disguise herself as a mysterious idol before she sings. Of course, everyone in Kanterbury knows that the beautiful idol is captain Eva. \n\nHer singing has built a cult fan base. She sometimes announces a small concert for her fans, which always turns into a massive fan gathering. Free from her duty as a knight for the moment, she presents the fans, or rather, her companions beautiful songs & dances full of smiles.",
  "profile_robot_tanker_story": "Oghma is a giant mecha robot.\n\n2.1m tall and weighs 527kg. A gnome inventor created by renovating an invader's armor. Nobody except the inventor and the invaders would know exactly what basic materials have been used. It can attack with a giant sword, and it can equip up to 6 missiles in the magazine behind its head. It can also create a vibration field and convey pressure on specific targeted areas by vibrating its body.\n\nThe pilot of Oghma is a gnome boy named Aidan. When the invaders invaded the Inn, Aidan almost gave up his life to protect Lord Smiley Face. More than half of his bones were broken after the malicious attack but was revived by the gnome inventor with the technology from the invaders' armor. Parts of his body parts were replaced with machines, transforming Aidan into a half cyborg. This made him the one and only pilot that can become one even to the soul with Oghma as he can control the mecha by connecting parts of his body to it.\n\nBefore becoming the Oghma pilot, Aidan was a boy with nothing but exaggerated heroism, acting as a self-appointed 'the hero of the Inn.' But after the battle with invaders and gaining a second chance in life, he has awakened to the real meaning of his life. That is to be the one to protect Lord Smiley Face, Loraine. Now, Aidan pretends to be a human to perform his sole duty to protect the world of Loraine the Smiley Face from the evil and the invaders.",

  "profile_festival_girl_story": "Miya is an exorcist who fights evil spirits with her dutiful souls.\r\n\r\nShe was born in a distinguished exorcist family, with a destiny to eradicate the foul and make the world a purer place with her innate spiritual powers. She can see things that are not visible to other people. Either by gently soothing them, or by conducting an exorcism, she leads the lost spirits to heaven. Though she has to constantly face the dark, she never loses her high spirit and kindness. She is affable to everybody, and willingly helps those who suffer from the evil deeds of demons and spirits.\r\n\r\nYet she has an issue, which is that she is very addicted to entertainment, especially to the festivals and gambling. Miya's family had the custom to hold a festival after a successful exorcism. It was to please the living, comfort the dead and to give a proper conclusion to everyone, so the elders said. Miya used to love these festivals. Perhaps a bit too much. Young Miya was greatly captivated by festivals filled with bright lanterns, music, fireworks and games.\r\n\r\nMiya played three-card monte as her first gambling game. Until she was dragged home in her neighborhood's hand who ran into Miya having too much fun, she won two times and lost six times in a row and nearly lost everything she had. She couldn't just forget the excitement, though. She secretly ran around playing games with her family treasures at stake, and ended up losing all her family's dutiful souls to all over the world. Her grandmother and the elders kicked her out of the house and ordered never to come back home unless she was with all the spirits she lost. Yet she still can't quit gambling, for she believes she can \"make it big with one shot\" and bring all of the lost spirits home. She often loses all her money earned from her exorcism, and always blames the ghosts saying \"they constantly tell her what to do and confuse her.\"\r",

Beth like all other Invaders learned and preached the words of the savior and trained to \"reclaim\" the world. Beth's cunning game of chess based on the maxim will always prevail. Pitiful savages would never understand it, and she pities the pitiful savages for not understanding it. Then who is the Guardian that casts doubt on Beth's faith. Everything else is as the prophecy, but the Guardian causing chaos and discord annoys Beth. Is the savior wrong, or is the Guardian's heresy corrupting savior's pureness. Beth has no choice but to be in doubt.\n\nShe loathes when someone calls her real name and everyone is required to call her priest. It seems to be a dearest name for her.\"",
  "profile_knight_captain_story": "Eva is the 19th captain of the guardians.\n\nBorn weak but talented in magic, everyone expected Eva will become a wizard. However, she chose to become a guardian against the odds. With exceptional leadership and chivalry, she quickly rose to captain. She completely transformed the guardians into the strictly merit based hierarchy where anyone, whether he/she is a noble or a peasant, can rise to higher ranks. The reform evolved the guardians into the most competitive and powerful knights in the world. She is dedicated to keep the guardians strong, to protect Kanterbury from any threat.\n\nSuch loyalty to the kingdom has earned her immense trust from queen Camilla and the royal family. She is not only a trusted servant but also a good friend to them.",

  "profile_steam_princess_story": "Aisha is a 7th princess of Rah Empire, the most powerful rival to Kanterbury Kingdom.\n\nShe is considered to have the best chance at the throne among her siblings. Many questioned the emperor's favoritism towards his seventh daughter, but she ended the controversy by displaying unmatched political finesse and intelligence. She excelled at leadership training and was well versed in the empire's situation inside out. Most of all, she had a very clear vision of the empire's future.\n\nShe is relatively small, but has a very strong and charismatic voice despite her size. It may sound cold, but it has power to attract the mass.",
  "profile_succubus_noble_story": "Bianca is a succubus lady from a prominent high-class noble family. \n\nShe was raised like a princess at home. The high-quality private education from her family, along with her natural strength and intelligence, made her an outstanding elite with both the brains and battle skills. She is extremely beautiful. She always wears tailored clothes, showing off the look of a perfect combination of a gentleman and a lady. She has extravagant taste and has a knack in \"aesthetics.\"\n\nUnlike normal succubi that seduce humans and absorb their energy, she summons and throws ice, pushing the enemy to move away from her. Due to this, although she aced her school subjects, her grades for the \"Seduction\" class were close to failure. It's very fortunate of her to have been born into a rich family, where she still can live without gaining human energy by herself.\n\nShe's from the same class as Yuze. She graduated second place after Yuze, who aced the mandatory Seduction class essential to the succubi. After having a tough time accepting her defeat, she thinks of Yuze as her rival—so much so that she changed her future career job from \"an orchestra maestro\" to \"an adventurer\" after seeing Yuze exclaim her dream to become one with such enthusiasm. In contrast to all this, Yuze considers Bianca as a smart and pretty friend. Bianca can't help herself sulking and pouting at Yuze, who is so undesigningly kind to her.",

  "profile_future_princess_story": "She was the little princess of Kanterbury. You'll meet her on Heavenhold after 10 years have passed. The little princess who used to dash around the Heavenhold now became an adult.\n\nYou, the Guardian took the adventure to the Rah Empire then never came back. It made the little princess anxious. She remembered leaving cheerful message to you when you called through the Rah Empire's payphone. You seemed fine to her back then. Whatever happened to you worried the princess. As she was very sure that the Emperor and the people of Rah Empire did some horrible stuff to you, Aisha arrived at the Heavenhold announcing the alliance between Rah Empire and Kanterbury Kingdom. Aisha and Shapira replied that they thought the Guardian already returned to Heavenhold.\n\nThe little princess couldn't possibly understand this sudden farewell. No one taught her that you have to accept the things you cannot understand. So the princess just waited and waited. Her knight always came back and greeted her first. There's no way her knight would have forgotten the duties they have promised to fulfill. The mischievous kids in Heavenhold bullied the princess telling her that 'Your knight ran away,' or 'Your sister and the Knight ran away cuz they hate you.' She drove those kids away, with such great vigor, and then got back to the Inn to shed the tears. The sound of her sorrow made even Loraine sad. Rumors spread among the champions. Some said you have died. Some said you have run away. Some said you were still fulfilling the duty as the Guardian. The princess trusted no one. Only the princess was confident that the astray Guardian would come back. The moment her long and the most strong conviction was shattered, the princess couldn't possibly handle the pain.\n\nPrincess' tears for the missing person slowly turned into tears of hatred over the years. There were so many tragedies that could have been prevented if you was there. Heavenhold now became the last line of defense for humanity. Friends struck down leaving only names and graves, and the enemies never gave chance to mourn their death. Princess is now a soldier protecting the remaining humans and also the leader of the Resistance to bring back the forsaken world. Through the training of Knight Captain Eva, the little princess grew up to be a resolute leader. Yet how tragic it is that her innocent smile is now replaced with such strictness and a little bit of fatigue.",
